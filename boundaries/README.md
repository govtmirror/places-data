# Places Boundaries

National Park boundaries are rendered into Park Tiles from our own NPMap boundaries database, `places_boundaries`, hosted on internal NPS servers. The geometries for park boundaries come from either the Land Resources Division Database (a.k.a. "Lands"), or directly from the parks themselves if they can provide a preferred version of their boundary. We store these geometries in our `places_boundaries` database and attach a number of cartographic attributes to help us render boundaries appropriately in our multi-scale Park Tiles basemaps. Thus, the display of park boundaries is controlled by NPMap cartographers, but the actual path of these geometries can only come from parks, regions, or the national Lands database.
